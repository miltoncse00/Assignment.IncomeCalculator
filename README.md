# Assignment IncomeCalculator
Details calculation of the Salary based on the pay frequency

Here I have added a json file **BudgetYearData.json** in the Repository project to populate 
   *  superannuation rate
   *  medicare levy calculation ranges
   *  budget levy calculation ranges 
   *  tax calculation ranges
 for a particular tax year as these values can be different on buget from one year to another.

This allow to extend the the application to calculate the salary for future or past based on the Date value and the tax or levy ranges can be different for budget years.


To **Run** the project nevigate to the **Assignment.IncomeCalculator** folder and open the command line

* Run the first command **dotnet build** to build the console project.
* After successfully build run the second command **dotnet run** to run the console project.
